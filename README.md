# LNO-for-Van-der-Pol-Oscillations
Discusses the application of the Laplace Neural Operator in the context of the forced Van der Pol oscillator use case. In the Van der Pol oscillator use case, the primary objective is to learn a neural operator GÎ¸ that maps the external forcing function f(t) to the system's response x(t).
